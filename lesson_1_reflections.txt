How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I don't know how a diff helped me see a bug. Maybe by comparing???? K!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It's so boring I won't even try!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manual gives you freedom of doing logical commits, but you may over/undersave or lose all data if file gets corrupted. Auto is great for not losing anything, but hard to track. Should be a mix of both!

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because the code from one file affects other files around

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

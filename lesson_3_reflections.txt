When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Maybe you want to share it with others? Maybe you just need a back-up in a cloud?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
For certain reasons.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A branch is a map of the commits. A clone is a copy of a repository. A fork is a clone on GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So you can keep track between local and remote

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It's hardef without. It would all rely on manual saving I guess.
